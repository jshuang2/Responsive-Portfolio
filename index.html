        <p>Hello! I'm a full-stack web development student currently based in Seattle, WA. Originally from Florence, KY, I moved here in May of 2019 with my best friend to not only pursue a career in tech, but also to fully immerse myself in the beautiful mountain ranges of the Pacific Northwest. 
      <br>
      <br>
        
        I currently work part-time for Amazon at their new 4-Star store in South Lake Union. Following my graduation from this program, I intend to pursue a job in either front-end development or UX Design. These are two skills/subject areas that I've really just jumped right into since graduating undergrad in 2017, and I'm working hard to make a career in either of these fields a reality.
      <br>
      <br>
    
        When I'm not coding or designing digital experiences, you can find me playing soccer on Sundays, hiking on the weekends, or just enjoying the company of my friends and playing video games.</p>
